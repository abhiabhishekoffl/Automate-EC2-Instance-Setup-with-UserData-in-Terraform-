To automate the setup of an EC2 instance using UserData in Terraform


🛠️ What is UserData?
UserData is a feature in AWS EC2 that allows you to run scripts or commands automatically when an instance starts. It’s perfect for automating setup tasks like installing software or configuring settings.

💻 Why Use Terraform?
Terraform makes managing infrastructure simple and scalable. By adding a UserData script to your EC2 resource, you can launch instances that are pre-configured and ready to go!

💡 How to Do It?
• Define your EC2 instance in Terraform.
• Add a UserData script block to specify your setup commands.
• Apply the Terraform configuration to launch and configure your EC2 instance automatically.

💡 Pro Tip: Automating EC2 setups reduces manual work and ensures consistency across environments!
